Mods found outside r2modman need to be installed a certain way, which depends on their [mod format](../mod_formats).

## Supported Formats

If you happen to obtain a mod from somewhere other than Thunderstore, it may be in a format that can be imported
directly into r2modman:

- r2modman packages
- Deli mods

If it is one of the above formats, install it via the `Import Local Mod` button within the `Settings` menu:

![local mod import](../images/r2modman/settings/import_local_mod.png)

Files imported by r2modman are placed into a folder within `BepInEx/plugins/` and may use other `BepInEx` folders as
needed, such as Sideloader mods.

> [!WARNING]
> Mods must be formatted a certain way for r2modman to understand them. If a mod is not in a supported format, it **cannot** be imported directly.

## Unsupported Mods

If a mod is not in a supported format, additional work is required.  
An unsupported mod may be [manually installed](manual_installation) or [packaged](packaging). Manual installation is quicker,
but packaging allows r2modman to manage it.
