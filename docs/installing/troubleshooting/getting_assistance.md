# Getting Assistance

If this article did not help to solve your issue then your next step is to ask for help in the `#modding-help` channel
of the [main H3VR server](https://discord.gg/gnXA9Qs4QM). Be sure to include your [BepInEx log](log_file.md) and as much
information about your issue as you can.
