Once you got H3VR skin-ready, we can move on to the Meat and Potatoes: making skins for guns! You will need various
programs to get started!

Tools needed:

- [UABE (Unity Asset Bundle Extracter)](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE/releases) (to gather meshes and textures from
  H3VR's asset files)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) (To package the meshes into a 'canvas')
- [Substance Painter](https://www.substance3d.com/subscribe/) (the recommended program in making skins, it does cost
  money but if you are a student, you can register for a license for educational purposes, look for "special offers for
  education")
- SkinPacker.exe (the application that makes hotmods for
  you) [(Direct Download)](https://github.com/denikson/H3VR.Sideloader/releases/download/v0.3.2/SkinPacker.exe)
- ["Alloy" preset for Substance Painter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705213552683646986/725554639763669032/Alloy.spexp)
