## Required files for Thunderstore

Thunderstore requires 3 files to be present in your `.zip` upload:

- An icon, 256x256 in size
- A Thunderstore manifest that contains information about your mod
- A README file that displays text and images on your main page

The best thing to do is to log into Thunderstore using Discord or Github and checking the full details on
the [upload page](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/create/).

Please see the [Creating a Thunderstore Package](creating.md) page for details on how to place your mod into this file
structure. After which, all you need to do is zip the files inside of the mod folder and upload it.

## Using TSGen to Generate required files

Head on over to [TSGen](https://github.com/nayr31/TSGen)'s github and download their latest release. You probably want
to download `TSGen_Extract_This.zip` and extract it to it's own folder.

Running `TSGen.exe` will greet you with this page:

![run tsgen](images/TSGen/run.png)

TSGen will prompt you for some general information about your mod:

- Mod name
- Version (It needs to be in the x.x.x format)
- Website url (usually for github links)
- Short description (displayed beside your mod in r2modman)
- Long description (displayed in the README file on the main page of your mod)

Next, it will prompt you for dependencies that your mod uses.

![tsgen dependencies](images/TSGen/dependencies.png)

Input the number that corresponds to the top level dependencies you need.

Example:

```text
Mod A requires WurstMod, Deli, and BepInEx

WurstMod requires Deli

Deli requires BepInEx

So Mod A's dependencies are:
- WurstMod
```

![tsgen finish](images/TSGen/finish.png)

In the above picture you can see what the example would do in it's situation. You can close TSGen now by hitting enter
or by closing the window.

Inside of the extracted TSGen folder, you should see a folder by the name of your mod:

```text
[Your mod name]/
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```

# Manual Creation

{: .note }
> The manifests created from TSGen can still be modified using this section.

### icon.png

`icon.png` is a box 256 pixels wide and tall. It is the icon that will be displayed on the Thunderstore website. Note
that it *must* be 256x256. If you are new to making images, a tool such
as [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html) can be useful for making quick images, as they are relatively easy
to learn.

### manifest.json

The default manifest looks like follows:

```json
{
  "name": "My_Mod_Name",
  "version_number": "1.0.0",
  "website_url": "https://thebestsiteevermadeforh3vrmodding.com",
  "description": "My mod is definitely a mod (250 characters max)",
  "dependencies": [
    "Author1-FirstDependency-Version",
    "Author2-SecondDependency-Version",
    "Author3-ThirdDependency-Version"
  ]
}
```

The name must not contain spaces. Replace your spaces with `_`s.

The `website_url` can be empty (`"website_url": "",`) if you do not have a website.

Dependencies are taken from the Thunderstore website. They are mods that your mod relies on. They can be seen from their
page on Thunderstore. Copy and paste the string listed to your dependencies.
![dependencies](images/thunderstore/dependencies.png)

{: .note }
> Once you have uploaded a mod under a name, *the name cannot be changed.*
> Also, it must be noted that *you can only upload once per version*. If you upload v1.0.0, you must change your version next time you upload.

### README.md

The README.md is the description by the mod. Often forgotten because it is not visible through the Mod Manager (As of
yet, anyway), it is what displays on Thunderstore when you click on a mod. You can test your markdown
through [Thunderstore's Markdown Preview tool.](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/tools/markdown-preview/) If you're new to
Markdown, [check out this guide!](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
Once you've fancied up your description, make a new text file and rename it to `README.md`. Open it up using a text
editor and paste your fancy text.

Once you have these three files, you should end up with this:

```text
[Your mod name]/
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```

Please see the [the next step, Adding Your H3VR Content To Your Package](creating.md) page for details on how to place
your mod into this file structure.
