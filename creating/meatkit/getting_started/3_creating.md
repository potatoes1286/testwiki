# Creating A Mod
Congratulations, you now know the basics of MeatKit and can start making your own mod!

Currently, MeatKit supports both Atlas and OtherLoader.
To make custom maps, check out the [Atlas section of the wiki](../../mapping/atlas/intro.md).
To make custom guns, check out the [video playlist guide for OtherLoader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BScDQiGCRAM&list=PL4xZPb3t-cEFkCxo648hdTulxKYy08thY)
