# MeatKit Technical Info
If you want to learn more about how MeatKit works under the hood,
you've come to the right place. ALL of these articles will be about super
technical information relating to Unity, how assets are stored in bundles,
and the import / export processes for MeatKit. You do not need to learn any
of this to use MeatKit, however should you be interested, having a deeper
understanding can significantly improve your workflow.

The articles will be separated into sections, organized into a typical MeatKit
workflow order. Import, develop, export, etc.
