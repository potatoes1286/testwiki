# Getting started with Atlas
Atlas uses a MeatKit project as the development environment. If you don't have a MeatKit project setup with the Atlas package imported, please reference the [MeatKit getting started guide](../../../meatkit/getting_started/1_setup.md).

# Summary
Once you have your project setup, continue to the next step; [The basics](2_the_basics.md).
