title: Skin Making Basics 5 - Exporting
---

Welcome back! It's been two weeks, and you've made a wonderful creation!

Now, time to export it!

File --> Export Textures...

Now before you jump the gun...

![popup exmaple](images/5_popup_1.png)

Do a double take, does it look like this?

Mainly, the config? Is it "alloy"?

If it ain't, make sure it is, so that H3VR can use it!

Make a folder called [ITEM NAME] - [NAME OF SKIN]

So, for my SPAS skin, it'd be Spas 12 - Bloodspring.

Make sure this folder is selected as the desired export location, then you are ready.

Click on "Export"!

Next up, [Step 6 - Hotmods](basics_6_hotmods.md).
