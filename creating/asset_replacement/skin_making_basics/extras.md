Hey! Thanks for reading this guide! Here are a few extras that will be of use to you!

## Skinmaker Skips

[Skinmaker Skip I](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ywizbrtzyr3ks99/TD%2527s_Skinmaker_Skip_V2.9.zip/file)

[Skinmaker Skip II](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2clbvged8q9wele/TD%2527s_Skinmaker_Skip_II.zip/file)

[Skinmaker Skip III](https://www.mediafire.com/file/5ira6qk23gy767o/TD%2527s_Skinmaker_Skip_III_V1.1.zip/file)

[Skinmaker Skip IV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18epbWVZOkfDDeELaKsGtcvoSGi_TYzMw/view?usp=sharing)

These four folders contain almost a hundred canvases ready for Substance Painter.

OBJ Files, Textures, and a manifest for you to copy and paste where your skin export is located, so that the Skinpacker
autofills for you almost all the details needed to make a Hotmod.

It's a handy tool that should cut the time substantially if that gun you were gonna make a skin of is within these
packs!

[Import Multiple Obj files in Blender python script](https://www.mediafire.com/file/v802g3ufu844pt0/io_import_multiple_objs.py/file)

From one skinmaker to another, this was passed to me to help cut time, and it does!

If you can't find your gun in the skinmaker skips, use this to cut time instead.
